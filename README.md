# Metro Operations Optimization Using Python

This repository contains a detailed analysis of Delhi Metro operations, aiming to optimize train schedules and passenger flow. The objective of this project is to analyze the available data to provide actionable insights for improving the efficiency of metro services.


## Introduction

The Delhi Metro is one of the largest metro systems in India, catering to millions of passengers every day. Optimizing metro operations is crucial for improving service efficiency, reducing waiting times, and enhancing passenger experience. This analysis utilizes historical data on train schedules, station entries, and passenger flows to identify patterns and offer optimization strategies.

## Business Task

The main objectives of this analysis are:

- Analyze train scheduling and passenger data to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
- Understand passenger demand during peak and off-peak hours.
- Develop strategies to improve train schedules and passenger management.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [Delhi Metro Operations Dataset](https://github.com/nithin0310/Delhi-Metro-Operations-Analysis). The dataset includes detailed information on train schedules, station-wise passenger entry and exit data, and other operational details.

## Data Preparation

The data preparation process involved the following steps:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data, filtering out irrelevant columns, and addressing inconsistencies to ensure data quality.
- **Data Transformation**: Aggregating station-wise data and transforming it into time-series formats for efficient analysis.
- **Data Validation**: Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of data across different time periods and stations.

## Analysis

Key analyses conducted include:

- **Train Scheduling Analysis**: Evaluating train schedules to identify inefficiencies and areas for improvement.
- **Passenger Flow Analysis**: Analyzing station-wise passenger entry and exit data to predict peak travel times and suggest adjustments to train frequency.
- **Demand Prediction**: Using time-series analysis and machine learning techniques to forecast passenger demand and recommend optimized schedules.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations were made:

1. **Dynamic Train Scheduling**: Introduce dynamic train scheduling based on real-time passenger flow to reduce overcrowding during peak hours.
2. **Station Reconfiguration**: Reevaluate station layouts and entry/exit points to ensure smooth passenger movement.
3. **Additional Trains during Peak Hours**: Deploy additional trains during high-demand hours to minimize waiting time.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights key insights into Delhi Metro operations, offering data-driven strategies for improving train scheduling, passenger flow management, and overall efficiency. For detailed insights, please refer to the `MetroOperationsAnalysis.ipynb` notebook.
